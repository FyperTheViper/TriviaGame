A trivia game with timed events.

The Link to my Geography Trivia: https://fypertheviper.github.io/TriviaGame/

I created a trivia game based on Geography questions. It will show only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it will display the next question. It also does this for wrong answers and time-outs.


If the player runs out of time, there will be a "time's up" display along with the correct answer. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, the correct answer is shown, along with another several second timeout.


On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game is presented.
