/*
Need to declare variables, a JSON object containing all the questions each with [question string, array of answers, correct answer, and any image assets]
Other variables - counter timer, answerRight, answerWrong, and an undefined variable that will populate with the object questions.

Functions - need to create functions which - gets the questions, clears the questions, populates the answers (with buttons I'm thinking), 
controls the timer, and displays the end results of right/wrong.

If there is time would like to create assets which frame the story of the trivia game(maybe a villian that you have to defeat by answering correctly)
